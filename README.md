# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: "toy app"

This is the second application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

This app serves as a high-level overview of a Rails
application.  It uses scaffolding to quickly 
generate an MVC setup for Users and Microposts.
It only has the most basic input validation
and pales in comparison to the larger app
we are building in chapters 3 and beyond.
